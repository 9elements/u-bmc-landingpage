      <h2 class="text-700 md:text-major leading-flat">WHY<br>U-BMC?</h2>
      <div class="column-text | text-300 md:text-400 stack-400">
        <p>You’re most likely going to come up with an answer that has something to do with managing servers remotely, or maybe debugging them. Both are valid use-cases for BMCs. In addition, some servers are manufactured to rely on the BMC for tasks such as fan control.</p>
        <p>This creates a problem, since the two previous stated use-cases (managing and debugging) requires high level of access to the host system and as a debugger the BMC has supreme access to critical resources, or as a system manager its function is critical for system relyability.</p>
        <p>A system that is both critical and highly privileged should be easy to audit, and employ modern security. Those are the goals of u-bmc.</p>
        <p>u-bmc sacrifices classical industry compatibility in order to offer a solution that is genuinely tailored for the mission. This usually results in a more secure implementation but also better integration with other systems in general. Example: IPMI is replaced with gRPC, and SNMP with OpenMetrics.</p>
        <p>To ease adoption for the users that require classical interfaces there are protocol adapters being planned that run off-BMC which converts from protocols like Redfish to gRPC.</p>

        <p>Historically BMCs have been considered insecure by nature and have received little to no attention - not unlike BIOSes.</p>
        <p>While LinuxBoot’s mission is to uplift BIOS firmware for existing servers, u-bmc’s is to uplift BMC firmware. The implementations differ, some things are shared, but the goal is the same.</p>
        <p>u-bmc, like LinuxBoot, sacrifices classical industry compatibility in order to offer a solution that is genuinely tailored for the mission. By close collaboration between LinuxBoot and u-bmc, the hope is to one day have servers that ship with a both free and open source firmware stack for the BMC as well as system BIOS.</p>
